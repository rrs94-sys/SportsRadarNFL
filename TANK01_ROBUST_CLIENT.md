# Production-Grade TANK01 Client - Complete Documentation

## Overview

**Status**: ✅ **PRODUCTION READY - Fault-Tolerant 2025 Data Ingestion**

This document describes the production-grade TANK01 API client designed to handle intermittent 504 Gateway Timeouts and other network issues when fetching 2025 NFL data.

---

## Problem Statement

### Original Issue
The TANK01 API (via RapidAPI) intermittently returns **504 Gateway Timeout** errors when fetching 2025 season data. The API key is valid, but the service experiences reliability issues that need to be handled gracefully.

**Error Pattern**:
```
504 Server Error: Gateway Time-out for url:
https://tank01-nfl-live-in-game-real-time-statistics-nfl.p.rapidapi.com/getNFLGamesForWeek...
```

### Requirements
- **Zero silent failures** - All errors must be logged and handled gracefully
- **Schema parity** - 2025 data must match historical data schema exactly
- **No model changes** - Don't modify model features or logic
- **Observable** - Full visibility into retry/fallback behavior

---

## Solution Architecture

### Multi-Layer Fault Tolerance

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│             REQUEST FLOW (Fail-Safe Design)                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

1. CHECK DISK CACHE
   ↓ (miss)
2. ATTEMPT PRIMARY API (retry with backoff)
   ↓ (5xx errors)
3. FAILOVER TO RAPIDFIRE MIRROR (retry with backoff)
   ↓ (all retries exhausted)
4. LOAD FROM REPO SAMPLE FILE
   ↓ (no sample)
5. RAISE CLEAR EXCEPTION (with full context)
```

### Key Components

| Component | Purpose | Key Features |
|-----------|---------|--------------|
| **RobustTank01Client** | HTTP client with fault tolerance | Retry, backoff, jitter, failover, caching |
| **Week Guard** | Prevent fetching incomplete weeks | Date-based + schedule-based detection |
| **Schema Validator** | Ensure data parity | Column/dtype checking, field mapping |
| **Structured Logging** | Full observability | Request/response details, timing, errors |
| **Sample Fallback** | Last-resort data source | Repo files for testing/development |

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. HTTP Client Configuration

#### Timeouts
```python
CONNECT_TIMEOUT = 3   # seconds - Fast connection attempt
READ_TIMEOUT = 15     # seconds - Allow time for data transfer
```

#### Retry Configuration
```python
RETRIABLE_STATUS_CODES = [429, 500, 502, 503, 504]
BACKOFF_SEQUENCE = [0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8]  # seconds
MAX_RETRIES = 5
RETRY_BUDGET_SECONDS = 30  # Stop after 30s total
```

#### Connection Pooling
```python
session = requests.Session()
session.headers.update({
    'Connection': 'keep-alive',
    'Accept': 'application/json',
})
```

### 2. Exponential Backoff with Jitter

**Formula**: `wait_time = base + random(0, base * 0.3)`

**Example Sequence**:
```
Attempt 1: Immediate
Attempt 2: Wait 0.5-0.65s (0.5 + 30% jitter)
Attempt 3: Wait 1.0-1.3s
Attempt 4: Wait 2.0-2.6s
Attempt 5: Wait 4.0-5.2s
```

**Special Case - 429 Rate Limit**:
```python
if response.status_code == 429:
    retry_after = response.headers.get('Retry-After')
    if retry_after:
        wait_time = int(retry_after)  # Respect server directive
```

### 3. Host Failover

**Hosts**:
- **Primary**: `tank01-nfl-live-in-game-real-time-statistics-nfl.p.rapidapi.com`
- **RapidFire Mirror**: `tank01-nfl-live-in-game-real-time-statistics-nfl-rapidfire.p.rapidapi.com`

**Failover Logic**:
- After 3 consecutive 5xx errors on primary → switch to mirror
- Headers automatically updated: `X-RapidAPI-Host` changes
- Logged for observability

### 4. Disk Cache Strategy

**Cache Structure**:
```
data_cache/tank01/
├── getNFLBoxScore_season=2025_seasonType=reg_week=1.json
├── getNFLBoxScore_season=2025_seasonType=reg_week=2.json
└── ...
```

**Behavior**:
- **Cache Hit**: Return immediately (no API call)
- **Cache Valid**: 24 hours from creation
- **Cache Miss**: Proceed to API call, then cache result

### 5. Sample File Fallback

**Purpose**: Last-resort data source when API completely fails

**Sample Structure**:
```
data/samples/tank01/
├── getNFLBoxScore_season=2025_seasonType=reg_week=1.json
├── getNFLBoxScore_season=2025_seasonType=reg_week=2.json
└── ...
```

**When Used**:
- All API retries exhausted (both hosts)
- No valid cache exists
- Sample file matches request parameters

**Creating Samples**:
```bash
# Save successful API response for future fallback
curl -X GET "https://tank01.../getNFLBoxScore?week=1&season=2025" \
  -H "X-RapidAPI-Key: YOUR_KEY" \
  > data/samples/tank01/getNFLBoxScore_season=2025_seasonType=reg_week=1.json
```

### 6. Week Guard

**Purpose**: Only fetch completed weeks (never future or in-progress)

**Logic**:
```python
def get_latest_completed_week_2025() -> int:
    """
    Returns latest COMPLETED week.

    Priority:
    1. Fetch from TANK01 schedule API
    2. Load from cached schedule
    3. Load from sample schedule
    4. Estimate from current date (conservative)
    """
```

**Date-Based Estimation** (fallback):
```python
# Conservative estimates by month
September: weeks 1-4
October: weeks 5-8
November: weeks 9-13
December: weeks 14-17
January: week 18
```

**Validation**:
```python
if week > latest_completed:
    raise ValueError(
        f"Week {week} has not completed yet. "
        f"Latest completed week: {latest_completed}"
    )
```

### 7. Schema Mapping & Validation

#### Field Mapping: TANK01 → nfl_data_py

| TANK01 Field | nfl_data_py Field | Type |
|--------------|-------------------|------|
| `playerID` | `player_id` | str |
| `longName` | `player_name` | str |
| `pos` | `position` | str |
| `team` | `team` | str |
| `Cmp` | `completions` | int |
| `Att` | `attempts` | int |
| `passYds` | `passing_yards` | int |
| `passTD` | `passing_tds` | int |
| `Int` | `interceptions` | int |
| `Sck` | `sacks` | int |
| `rushCarries` | `carries` | int |
| `rushYds` | `rushing_yards` | int |
| `rushTD` | `rushing_tds` | int |
| `Tgt` | `targets` | int |
| `Rec` | `receptions` | int |
| `recYds` | `receiving_yards` | int |
| `recTD` | `receiving_tds` | int |

#### Required Columns (All Must Be Present)
```python
['player_id', 'player_name', 'position', 'team', 'season', 'week',
 'game_id', 'attempts', 'completions', 'passing_yards', 'passing_tds',
 'interceptions', 'sacks', 'carries', 'rushing_yards', 'rushing_tds',
 'targets', 'receptions', 'receiving_yards', 'receiving_tds']
```

#### DType Enforcement
```python
# String columns
string_cols = ['player_id', 'player_name', 'position', 'team', 'game_id']
→ dtype: object

# Integer columns (all stats)
int_cols = ['season', 'week', 'attempts', 'completions', ...]
→ dtype: int64
```

### 8. Concurrency Control

```python
# Limit in-flight requests to prevent overwhelming API
REQUEST_SEMAPHORE = threading.Semaphore(3)  # Max 3 concurrent

with REQUEST_SEMAPHORE:
    response = make_api_call()
```

### 9. Structured Logging

Every request logged with full context:

```python
@dataclass
class RequestLog:
    endpoint: str              # e.g., '/getNFLBoxScore'
    host: str                  # Which host was used
    params: Dict[str, Any]     # Request parameters
    status: Optional[int]      # HTTP status code
    attempt: int               # Which retry attempt (1-5)
    latency_ms: float          # Response time
    cache_hit: bool            # Was cache used?
    fallback_used: bool        # Was sample file used?
    error: Optional[str]       # Error message if failed
    response_preview: Optional[str]  # First 300 chars of response
```

**Example Log Output**:
```
2025-10-24 15:30:45 [INFO] Tank01Client initialized. Cache: data_cache/tank01
2025-10-24 15:30:46 [INFO] ✓ Cache hit: /getNFLBoxScore {'season': '2025', 'week': '1'}

## API Functions (Drop-In Contracts)

### 1. `fetch_tank01(path, params) -> dict`

**Core HTTP client function.**

```python
from tank01_client_robust import RobustTank01Client

client = RobustTank01Client()

# Fetch box score for week 1
data = client.fetch_tank01(
    path='/getNFLBoxScore',
    params={'season': '2025', 'seasonType': 'reg', 'week': '1'}
)

# Returns JSON dict with box score data
# Automatically handles: retry, backoff, failover, caching, fallback
```

**Error Handling**:
```python
from tank01_client_robust import Tank01NetworkError

try:
    data = client.fetch_tank01('/test', {'param': 'value'})
except Tank01NetworkError as e:
    print(f"All attempts failed: {e}")
```

### 2. `get_latest_completed_week_2025() -> int`

**Get the latest completed week for 2025.**

```python
from tank01_client_robust import get_latest_completed_week_2025

latest_week = get_latest_completed_week_2025()
print(f"Latest completed week: {latest_week}")

# Returns: 1-18 (or 0 if season hasn't started)
```

### 3. `load_2025_week(week) -> pd.DataFrame`

**Load single week of 2025 data.**

```python
from tank01_client_robust import load_2025_week

# Load week 1 data
df = load_2025_week(week=1)

print(f"Loaded {len(df)} player-weeks")
print(f"Columns: {list(df.columns)}")

# DataFrame schema matches nfl_data_py exactly
```

**Validates week is completed**:
```python
try:
    df = load_2025_week(week=100)  # Future week
except ValueError as e:
    print(e)  # "Week 100 has not completed yet..."
```

### 4. `load_2025_season(up_to_week) -> pd.DataFrame`

**Load full 2025 season up to specified week.**

```python
from tank01_client_robust import load_2025_season

# Load all available weeks
df = load_2025_season()  # Auto-detects latest completed

# Or specify week
df = load_2025_season(up_to_week=8)

print(f"Loaded {len(df)} player-weeks from weeks 1-8")

# Returns combined DataFrame with all weeks merged
```

### 5. `merge_historical_and_2025(historical, current2025) -> pd.DataFrame`

**Merge historical (≤2024) with 2025 data.**

```python
from tank01_client_robust import merge_historical_and_2025

# Load historical from nfl_data_py
historical = nfl.import_weekly_data([2022, 2023, 2024])

# Load 2025 from TANK01
current2025 = load_2025_season()

# Merge with schema validation
combined = merge_historical_and_2025(historical, current2025)

print(f"Total: {len(combined)} player-weeks")
print(f"Seasons: {combined['season'].unique()}")

# Validates column alignment and dtypes
```

---

## Usage Examples

### Basic Usage - Load 2025 Data

```python
from tank01_client_robust import load_2025_season

# Load all available 2025 data
df_2025 = load_2025_season()

print(f"✓ Loaded {len(df_2025)} player-weeks")
print(f"✓ Weeks: {sorted(df_2025['week'].unique())}")
print(f"✓ Players: {df_2025['player_id'].nunique()}")
```

### Integration with Existing Pipeline

```python
from nfl_data_utils import load_hybrid_data

# This now automatically uses robust client for 2025
data = load_hybrid_data(
    historical_years=3,    # 2022-2024 from nfl_data_py
    current_through_week=None  # Auto-detect for 2025 from TANK01
)

# Log output:
# ✓ Retry logic: Exponential backoff for 504/503/502/500/429
# ✓ Host failover: Primary → RapidFire mirror if needed
# ✓ Fallback: Disk cache → Sample files
# ✓ Week guard: Only completed weeks
```

### Error Handling

```python
from tank01_client_robust import (
    load_2025_week,
    Tank01NetworkError,
    Tank01ValidationError
)

try:
    df = load_2025_week(week=5)
except ValueError as e:
    print(f"Week not completed: {e}")
except Tank01NetworkError as e:
    print(f"Network failure: {e}")
except Tank01ValidationError as e:
    print(f"Schema mismatch: {e}")
```

---

## Testing

### Run Unit Tests

```bash
python test_tank01_robust.py -v
```

**Test Coverage**:
- ✅ Retry/backoff/jitter behavior (mock 504 → success)
- ✅ 429 with Retry-After header
- ✅ Disk cache hit/miss
- ✅ Sample file fallback
- ✅ Schema validation (columns, dtypes)
- ✅ Week guard (prevents future weeks)
- ✅ Host failover logic
- ✅ Parameter normalization

### Manual Testing

```bash
# Test with actual API
python tank01_client_robust.py

# Expected output:
# Testing TANK01 client...
# Latest completed week: 8
# Week 1 data: 450 rows
# Columns: ['player_id', 'player_name', 'position', ...]
```

## Observability & Monitoring

### Check Logs

All requests logged to console:

```
2025-10-24 15:30:45 [INFO] LOADING 2025 WEEK 1
2025-10-24 15:30:46 [INFO] ✓ Cache hit: /getNFLBoxScore
2025-10-24 15:30:47 [WARNING] ⚠️  HTTP 504 (attempt 1/5). Retrying in 0.5s...
2025-10-24 15:30:48 [INFO] ✓ Request successful (attempt 2/5, 1250ms)
2025-10-24 15:30:49 [INFO] ✅ Week 1 loaded: 450 player-weeks
```

### Key Metrics to Monitor

1. **Cache Hit Rate**: How often cache is used vs API
2. **Retry Rate**: % of requests requiring retries
3. **Failover Rate**: How often alternate host is used
4. **Fallback Rate**: How often sample files are needed
5. **Average Latency**: Time to complete requests

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: All retries exhausted, no sample file

**Symptom**:
```
Tank01NetworkError: Failed to fetch /getNFLBoxScore after 5 attempts
across all hosts and no sample file available.
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Create sample file** from successful API response
2. **Check API key** is valid and has correct permissions
3. **Wait and retry** - API may be temporarily down
4. **Use cached data** - Previous successful fetches are cached

### Issue: Schema validation fails

**Symptom**:
```
Tank01ValidationError: Missing required columns: ['passing_yards', 'receptions']
```

**Solutions**:
1. **Update field mapping** in `Tank01FieldMapping` class
2. **Check API response** - TANK01 may have changed field names
3. **Verify API version** - Ensure using correct endpoint

### Issue: Week guard prevents loading

**Symptom**:
```
ValueError: Week 10 has not completed yet. Latest completed week: 8
```

**Solution**: This is working correctly! Only completed weeks should be loaded. Either:
- Wait for week to complete
- Or manually override (not recommended)

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Typical Request Times

| Scenario | Time | Details |
|----------|------|---------|
| Cache hit | <10ms | No network call |
| Successful API call | 500-2000ms | Single attempt |
| 1 retry (504) | 1500-3000ms | +0.5-0.65s backoff |
| 2 retries (504) | 3000-5000ms | +cumulative backoff |
| Failover + success | 4000-7000ms | Switch host mid-retry |
| Complete failure + sample | 30000ms+ | All retries + sample load |

### Memory Usage

- **Per Week**: ~5-10 MB DataFrame
- **Full Season (18 weeks)**: ~100-180 MB
- **Cache Files**: ~1-2 MB per week (JSON)

---

## Deployment Checklist

- [ ] **API Key** configured in `phase1_config.py`
- [ ] **Cache directory** exists and is writable (`data_cache/tank01/`)
- [ ] **Sample files** created for fallback (optional but recommended)
- [ ] **Logging** configured appropriately for environment
- [ ] **Tests** passing (`python test_tank01_robust.py`)
- [ ] **Schema validation** verified with historical data
- [ ] **Week guard** tested (won't fetch future weeks)
- [ ] **Integration** tested with existing pipeline

---

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:

1. **Schedule Loading**: Robust client currently focuses on player stats
2. **Parallel Week Loading**: Fetch multiple weeks concurrently (with rate limit respect)
3. **Metrics Dashboard**: Real-time monitoring of retry/fallback rates
4. **Smart Caching**: Refresh cache based on data staleness detection
5. **Auto Sample Generation**: Automatically save successful responses as samples

---

## Summary

### What This Solves

✅ **504 Gateway Timeouts** - Retry with exponential backoff
✅ **Intermittent failures** - Host failover to RapidFire mirror
✅ **API unavailability** - Disk cache + sample file fallback
✅ **Schema mismatches** - Automatic field mapping + validation
✅ **Future week requests** - Week guard prevents invalid fetches
✅ **Silent failures** - Structured logging + clear exceptions
✅ **Rate limits** - Respects 429 Retry-After headers
✅ **Concurrency issues** - Semaphore limits in-flight requests

### Result

A **production-grade, fault-tolerant system** that:
- Continues working even when TANK01 API has issues
- Provides full observability into retry/fallback behavior
- Maintains perfect schema parity with historical data
- Never silently fails - all errors are logged and handled
- Respects week boundaries (only completed weeks)

**Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PRODUCTION USE**
