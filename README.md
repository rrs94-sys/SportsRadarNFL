## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- 10GB free disk space (for data caching)
- API keys (see below)

### Setup

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>

```

### API Keys

1. **SportsGameOdds** (500 calls/month free)
   - Sign up at https://sportsgameodds.com/
   - Already configured: `0b4d590cc09e7cfe05da2247b338698e`

## Quick Start

### 1. Train Models (with Backtesting)

```bash
# Run time-series backtest + train final models
python train_models.py --through-week 8

# Or separately:
python train_models.py --backtest --through-week 7  # Backtest
python train_models.py --train --through-week 8     # Train final models
```

**What happens:**
- Loads data from last 3 seasons + 2025 (30% historical, 70% recent)
- Runs time-series backtest:
  - Train 1-4, validate 5-6
  - Train 1-5, validate 6-7
  - Train 1-6, validate 7-8
- Trains final models on weeks 1-8
- Saves models to `saved_models_v2/`

### 2. Generate Predictions

```bash
# Predict Week 9
python predict_props.py --week 9

# Predict specific season/week
python predict_props.py --week 10 --season 2025
```

**What happens:**
1. Loads trained models
2. Fetches current lines from SportsGameOdds (cached to minimize API calls)
3. Loads injury data and weather forecasts
4. Generates predictions for all active players
5. Runs 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations per prop
6. Filters by hit rate (≥54% by default)
7. Applies position-specific edge thresholds
8. Calculates Kelly bet sizes
9. Optimizes portfolio with correlation controls
10. Outputs CSV with final recommendations

### 3. Review Output

```bash
# Output file: week9_predictions_YYYYMMDD_HHMM.csv
```

**Output columns:**
- `player_name`, `team`, `position`, `opponent`
- `market` (e.g., receiving_yards)
- `line`, `prediction`, `recommendation` (OVER/UNDER)
- `mc_over_rate` (Monte Carlo hit rate)
- `edge`, `edge_threshold`
- `kelly_fraction`, `bet_size`
- `correlation_adjustment`

## Configuration

Edit `phase1_config.py` to customize:

### Bankroll & Betting
```python
INITIAL_BANKROLL = 10000
KELLY_FRACTION = 0.25  # Quarter Kelly
MIN_EDGE = 0.05  # 5% minimum edge
MAX_BET = 500
MAX_CORRELATED_EXPOSURE = 0.15  # 15% max on correlated bets
```

### Position-Specific Settings
```python
# Quantile targets (higher for volatile props)
QUANTILE_TARGETS = {
    'receiving_yards': 0.60,
    'receptions': 0.58,
    'receiving_tds': 0.70,
    'rushing_yards': 0.65,
    ...
}

# Edge thresholds (higher for lower R² props)
EDGE_THRESHOLDS = {
    'receiving_yards': 1.0,
    'rushing_yards': 2.0,  # Higher due to game script dependency
    ...
}
```

### Monte Carlo
```python
MONTE_CARLO_ITERATIONS = 10000
MC_MIN_HIT_RATE = 0.54  # Minimum 54% to bet (beats -110 juice)
```

---

## Advanced Usage

### Weekly Micro-Update (Recommended)

After each week, update models with new data:

```bash
# Append Week 9 results
python train_models.py --train --through-week 9

# This does isotonic calibration re-fit only (fast)
```

### Monthly Macro-Retrain

Every 3-4 weeks, full retrain:

```bash
python train_models.py --backtest --train --through-week 12
```

### API Usage Monitoring

```python
from sportsgameodds_client import SportsGameOddsClient

client = SportsGameOddsClient()
usage = client.get_api_usage_stats()
print(f"API calls: {usage['calls_used']}/{usage['monthly_limit']}")
```

## Model Performance

### Backtest Results (Week 1-7 → Week 8)

| Prop Type | MAE | R² | Edge@1.0 ROI | Hit Rate | Samples |
|-----------|-----|----|--------------| ---------|---------|
| receiving_yards | 17.8 | 0.108 | +5.2% | 53.4% | 593 |
| receptions | 1.32 | 0.115 | +6.1% | 54.1% | 593 |
| rushing_yards | 17.7 | 0.042 | +3.8% | 52.8% | 289 |
| completions | 5.80 | 0.092 | +4.5% | 53.2% | 113 |

### Key Insights

✅ **What Works:**
- Quantile regression (τ=0.60) > median predictions
- GroupKFold CV prevents leakage
- 70+ features > complex models with few features
- Market optimization > statistical accuracy
- Recency weighting (30/40/30) outperforms equal weighting

❌ **What Doesn't:**
- Historical seasons (2019-2021) hurt performance
- Deep learning overfits small datasets
- MAE/R² optimization ≠ profitable betting
- Mean predictions lose to sharp lines

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**1. API Rate Limit Exceeded**
```
⚠️ SGO API limit reached!
```
**Solution**: System uses cached lines automatically. Wait until next month or upgrade SGO plan.

**2. Missing Historical Data**
```
❌ No data for receiving_yards
```
**Solution**: Run `python phase1_ingestion.py` to download/cache data first.

**3. No Predictions Generated**
```
⚠️ No props meet hit rate threshold
```
**Solution**: Lower `MC_MIN_HIT_RATE` in config or increase data lookback.

XGBRegressor(
    objective='reg:quantileerror',
    quantile_alpha=τ,  # Position-specific
    n_estimators=500,
    max_depth=6,
    learning_rate=0.03,
    reg_alpha=0.1, reg_lambda=1.0

2. **Volatility** (4): CV, boom/bust flags
3. **Home/Road** (4): Splits and differentials
4. **Rest/Travel** (3): Days rest, timezone changes
5. **Matchup** (3): Historical vs opponent
6. **Usage** (10): Target share, route %, air yards, red zone

### Cross-Validation

```python
GroupKFold(n_splits=5)
# Groups = game_id to prevent leakage
# Same game never in both train and val
```

### Evaluation Focus

**Primary Metric:** Edge@k ROI (not MAE/R²)

```python
# Filter to edges ≥ k
# Calculate: (wins * 0.909 - losses) / total_bets
# Goal: Maximize ROI, not minimize MAE
```

## Best Practices

### Do's ✅

- ✅ Monitor SGO API usage
- ✅ Filter by MC hit rate ≥ 54%
- ✅ Use fractional Kelly (¼ or ½)

- ✅ Check injury reports before betting
- ✅ Update models weekly
- ✅ Track CLV (closing line value)

### Don'ts ❌
- ❌ Don't bet without Monte Carlo confirmation
- ❌ Don't ignore edge thresholds
- ❌ Don't exceed correlation limits
- ❌ Don't bet on injured/inactive players
- ❌ Don't chase high lines without huge edge
- ❌ Don't trust predictions with R² < 0
- ❌ Don't optimize for MAE instead of ROI
