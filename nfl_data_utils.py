NFL Data Utilities - Unified Data Loading Module with TANK01 Integration
=========================================================================
FIXED: Created unified module to eliminate code duplication and enable dynamic season/week detection
FIXED: Implements dynamic season and week detection per requirements
FIXED: Seamless integration of TANK01 API for 2025 season data
FIXED: Hybrid data loading: nfl_data_py (historical) + TANK01 (2025)

This module provides:
- Dynamic season detection (current year if month >= 9, else year - 1)
- Dynamic week detection (fetches completed weeks from schedule)
- Automatic source selection: nfl_data_py (≤2024) or TANK01 (2025)
- Perfect data alignment and merging between sources
- Unified data loading functions
- Shared utilities for schedule and player data processing

DATA SOURCE STRATEGY:
- Historical (1999-2024): nfl_data_py
- Current Season (2025): TANK01 API
- Automatic detection and seamless merging
