NFL Data Utilities - Unified Data Loading Module with nflreadpy
================================================================
FIXED: Created unified module to eliminate code duplication and enable dynamic season/week detection
FIXED: Implements dynamic season and week detection per requirements
FIXED: Migration from nfl_data_py (deprecated) to nflreadpy for 2025 support
FIXED: Normalized to single API source (nflreadpy) for all seasons (1999-2025)
FIXED: Added play-by-play (PBP) data loading for enhanced feature engineering

This module provides:
- Dynamic season detection (current year if month >= 9, else year - 1)
- Dynamic week detection (fetches completed weeks from schedule)
- Single normalized data source: nflreadpy (1999-2025)
- Play-by-play (PBP) data loading for detailed analysis
- 30/70 weighting model (30% historical, 70% recent)
- Unified data loading functions
- Shared utilities for schedule and player data processing
- Compatibility shim for nfl_data_py ‚Üí nflreadpy migration

DATA SOURCE STRATEGY:
- All Seasons (1999-2025): nflreadpy (Polars-first with pandas conversion)
- Default lookback: 5 full seasons for historical data
- 30/70 weighting: 30% weight on historical, 70% weight on current season

NOTE: nfl_data_py was deprecated in Sep 2025. This module now uses nflreadpy
      (Polars-first, with automatic pandas conversion) for all data.
